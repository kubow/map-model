## Google Earth Pro

  
On the [Google Enterprise Portal](https://google.secure.force.com/) you'll find this announcement :  
''As of January 20, 2015, Google Earth Pro is free and is no longer available to purchase. Customer support for Earth Pro will be provided until the end of your current contract, after which point you may continue to get help through the public forum ([https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!categories/maps/google-earth](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!categories/maps/google-earth)).  
Although Earth Pro is now free, a valid key is still required to access the application. For your convenience, we have extended all existing keys so that they will no longer expire: no additional work is required for you to continue using Earth Pro for free. (…)  
New users wishing to use Earth Pro for the first time can sign up for a free full-featured key at [https://geoauth.google.com/gev0/free_trial.html](https://geoauth.google.com/gev0/free_trial.html).  
If your questions regarding this change haven't been answered by this document, you can file a case here: [https://support.google.com/earth/?contact=1](https://support.google.com/earth/?contact=1).'  
Our current account manager confirms that, from now on, all Earth Pro licences are available for free and that the product features are remaining exactly the same. You do not need to change anything in the way you are using the product, **as long as it remains within the terms & conditions** (emphasized by me - see the following link for the terms & conditions). After our subscription ends, all use of Google Earth Pro will be based on the Google Earth Consumer Term of Use.
